- Collision shape of mono-hull ASV and its rendering

- Incorporate ASV sensors: compass, GPS position sensor, range-and-bearing 
sensor, a Wi-Fi communication module, and bumper sensors on the front hull.

- Provide a example code for a swarm of ASVs 

- Implement the MAP-Elites algorithm for argos3-asv, or interface argos3-asv with sferes_v2

- Interface argos3-asv with nn2 neural net library
