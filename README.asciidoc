What is ARGoS-ASV?
---------------

ARGoS-ASV is a plugin that implements an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) robot in ARGoS. 
The surface vehicle implemented is a differential drive mono-hull boat. The ARGoS-ASV contains 
the software modules for the 2D simulated version of this ASV. Depending on the needs of the 
user, the capabilities of the basic model of the ASV can be enhanced with the following 
extensions: a compass, GPS position sensor, range-and-bearing sensor, a Wi-Fi communication 
module, and bumper sensors on the front hull of the ASV.


Downloading ARGoS-ASV
------------------

You can download the development sources of ARGoS-ASV through git:

 $ git clone https://github.com/daneshtarapore/argos3-asv.git argos-asv

Compiling ARGoS
----------------

Requirements and compiling instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirements and compiling instructions for ARGoS-ASV are the same as that of the ARGoS simulator, 
described at https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3/README.txt. However please note that in addition 
to the libraries required to compile ARGoS, ARGoS-ASV also requires Eigen3 library development 
files (libeigen3-dev; see http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).
